TODO:

Change depth to height
For constant calibration change name of arg from target to value

Should fuel types be assigned before parameters?
    - How things are now:
        - Targets: only methods and values -- this should stay as is!
        - FuelParameters: targets are assigned to various parameters for ONE fuel type
            - The fuel type is named in the class
        - Those FuelParameters objects then get put in a list within calibrate
            - That list should, in theory, only include grass, litter, both, or "all"
            - BUT what if you want to calibrate the density all together, but the height separately?
    - What if we switched the order of things?
        - Targets: this stays the same, because a Targets object doesn't know about fuel parameters or types
        - FuelParameters: Instead of a named fuel type, it should be identified by a parameter
            - OLD: assign_fuel_parameters(fuel_type = "grass", density=ld, moisture=lm, height=lh)
            - NEW: create 3 functions: set_density, set_height, set_moisture
                - All create a FuelParameter object!
                - set_density(grass = gd, litter = ld)
                - set_moisture(grass = gm)
                - set_height(all = ah)
                - Now calibrate() still takes a list of FuelParameter objects, but they represent fuel parameters!
                    - calibrate(duet_run, parameter_targets = [dens_targs, moist_targs, height_targs])
